            <strong>How did this come about? (Phase 1 of Research)</strong>
            <p>
              Diversity is a very personal subject which can be difficult to discuss. A lot of the time, people need more detail about the contexts in which words are used. We noted as we were starting conversations about projects related to the Diverse Data programme, it because increasingly apparent that language was being used inconsistently across the business.
              <br><br>
              As part of our Diverse Data Programme, we conducted an initial three-month research project into how diversity is understood by different groups of people at GEL.
              <br><br>
              The initial phase of research included:
              <ul>
                <li> Desk research on existing work done at GEL </li>
                <li> A literature review of papers </li>
                <li> 1-1 interviews with 28 experts across GEL </li>
                <li> 3 focus groups and workshops with ELT, Cancer, Rare Disease and Newborns team </li>
                <li> GEL-wide survey on language around diversity. </li>
              </ul>
              This Language Toolkit comprises the most commonly requested and most debated terminology. We aim to provide context so that you can decide whether or not to use a word yourself.
              <br><br>
              The Language Toolkit responds to a wish and need expressed by GEL Employees that came out of an in-depth Language confidence survey in February 2022.
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li> 62% of respondents have a bioinformatic, clinical or genomic science background </li>
                <li> Trans-ancestry, super-populations, admixed and decolonisation were the top terms people wanted more context about. </li>
                <li> There was a strong interest in guidelines for how to use words that focused on the history and debate of complicated words </li>
                <li> Particular interest was drawn on the need for guidance on appropriate use of words </li>
              </ul>

            <strong>What are the goals and audience of the toolkit?</strong>
            <p>
              We hope that the Language Toolkit will spark discussion about the language that we use at Genomics England. We also hope that the Language Toolkit will help us prevent harmful uses of words that could further marginalise different groups of people. Ultimately, we hope that a change in language can enable for a more accurate articulation of the key challenges facing us in using genomic data, designing research studies, and meaningfully involving participants to build a more equitable world.
              <br><br>
              Originally, the toolkit was primarily for internal use at Genomics England but is now published externally as an open resource. It is for anyone working in the field of genomics, with a scientific background or otherwise, who need to communicate key terminology around race, ethnicity and ancestry across multiple genomic and societal contexts.
              <br><br>
              We hope that this work will spark discussion about the language that we use at Genomics England. In time, we hope this work expands further afield to genomics and biosciences to consider how the social and political contexts play a vital role in the science and observations we produce.

            <strong>Why is it called the "Lost in Translation" Language Toolkit?</strong>
            <p>
              The name is a pun that references the translation process in Genomics, which is the name of the process of translating RNA to proteins. Credit to Diksha Srivastava for coming up with this name.

            <strong>What is the traffic light system?</strong>
            <p>
              All phrases in the toolkit are categorised as one of:
              <ul>
                <li>Green Listed - Generally accepted for use in the context defined</li>
                <li>Amber Listed - The contexts in which the word is used is often confused</li>
                <li>Red Listed - This term should be avoided, or there are better alternatives.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              We are not here to 'police' your language. We have provided a traffic light system to help you understand if this term is generally accepted, no longer considered respected or accurate by those we spoke to, or heavily debated.<br>
              This is based on:
              <ul>
                <li>Frequency of how the word is debated in the literature.</li>
                <li>NHS Race and Health Observatory Guidance</li>
                <li>Opinions and debates raised from research Genomics England commissioned with Maslansky</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <strong>Methods Disclaimer:</strong>
              A major challenge within genomics when tackling diversity is the conflation of race and "biological" variables. At Genomics England, we are clear that race has no biological basis.  Ancestry, pure, and mixed race are all terms that are based on a system of categorising humans according to continents and a corresponding race.
              If we completely deconstruct these terms, we end up examining the roots of human taxonomy and racial constructs. The history of categorising humans is extremely troubling and outside the scope of this toolkit. However, we raise it here as important context for the ongoing debate around language, race and taxonomy.
              Our goal is to create common ground for language and to make a useful toolkit to avoid imprecise use of words which may lead to harm and further alienate.

            <strong>What happens if you can't agree on the 'Traffic light' category?</strong>
            <p>
              Given that we want to engage with as many people as possible from a range of backgrounds, there are likely to be some words were the exact placement of them is debated. A great example of this are words in the amber category, which have multiple different contexts. To help us decide on categories, we use the following rules:
              <ol>
                <li>Words particularly affecting a certain group are defined by them.</li>
                <li>In order to be precise, we avoid acronyms where possible (some phrases are always referred to by their acronym!) and specify which field the word comes from.</li>
                <li>We know that language is changing all the time and we want the Language Toolkit
                to feel like a mutual process. Therefore, this is a 'live' toolkit that is regularly updated.</li>
                <li>We ensure our definitions are succinct and that we are transparent if we cannot categorise a word - we do not categorise for the sake of it.</li>
              </ol>

            <strong>How are new phrases added to the toolkit?</strong>
            <p>Anyone can suggest a new phrase and classification by opening a <a href="https://github.com/link23-world/language-toolkit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+phrase&projects=&template=new-phrase-request.md&title=%5BNEWPHRASE%5D+%3Cadd_your_phrase_here%3E">'New Phrase request' issue on GitHub</a>.
            Contributors are asked to provide 2-3 sources supporting the categorisation for their new phrase. We prioritise sources that are written by authors mots affected by the term, for example Black authors for the word 'Black'. We then ask our community to comment on the issue and debate the classification, and the resulting discussion is used to categorise the phrase and fill-in the phrase content. We make choices based on majority consensus and prioritise perspectives of those with characteristics that would mean they are most affected by misuse of the term.</p>
