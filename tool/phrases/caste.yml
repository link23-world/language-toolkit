name: 'Caste'
status: 'gray'
definition:
  'Caste is any of the ranked, hereditary, endogamous social groups, often linked with occupation, that together constitute traditional societies in South Asia, particularly among Hindus in India. Caste is not the same as class, or other social hierarchies and is unique.


  Please note, another use of caste has been used in the identification of groups under Spanish colonialist rule, for example in countries like the Philippines, where Spanish colonisers created a similar, ancestry-based caste system for tax purposes.'

why_we_care:
  'Understanding Caste helps geneticists to uncover links between social status and historic population dynamics. By studying different castes, geneticists can better understand genetic homogeneity, allowing them to trace different genotypes for diseases. For example, in India, the admixture of (northern and southern) genetic populations has resulted in castes having more Western Eurasian ancestry in higher ranks (Moorjani et al.,Â 2013.)'
