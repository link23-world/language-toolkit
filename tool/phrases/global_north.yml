why_we_care:
  'The vast majority of our genome data comes from the Global North. This can lead to lower predictive accuracy and diagnostic yield in populations from the Global South. This can be a threat to increase the diversity in genomic data and may lead challenging health disparities in the near future.'
alternatives:
  - 'In 2016, the World Bank gave up using the terms altogether in favour of lower-, middle- and upper-income countries.'
context:
  'In an **everyday context** Global South has come to refer generally to economically disadvantaged areas and peoples. Global South can also be an umbrella term for colonial resistance.


    In a **political context** Global North and South are critical terms that describe geographies and peoples who are either benefiting from or suffering under the current economic system of capitalism.'
debate:
  'It is helpful to be aware of the political connotations: Global North and Global South were terms born out of colonial resistance and to some extent, the Non-aligned movement of the Cold War.'
