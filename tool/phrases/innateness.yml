name: 'Innateness'
status: 'amber'
definition:
  'This word is used to describe any trait or characteristic that is considered to be inherent to an entity, sample, person, etc. The problem with this word is that it can strip away other influencing factors and context, and assigns culpability and control solely to the entity in question. For example, we might say that "Group X has some innate biochemical factors that predispose them to disease Y". In doing so, we have to be aware that some could interpret this to mean that only those innate biochemical factors are responsible for that disease in every member of group X with no other contributing factors.'

why_we_care:
  'There are some innate factors that lead to disease predisposition.'
alternatives:
  - 'Make sure you include all available context when talking about innateness, including socio-cultural. Make sure that you also interpret results from a sociological lens and provide evidence of this. If you are using this word, make sure you provide more context around other contributing factors to certain health outcomes.'
