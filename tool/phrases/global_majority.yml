name: 'Global Majority'
status: 'green'
definition:
  'The term Global majority was coined by Rosemary Campbell Stephens is from the UK, in opposition to referring to racialised others as "minorities". She developed the term through her work in education to disrupt deficit narratives around race and terms like "ethnic minority". The term specifically refers to those who identify as Black, Asian, Arabic, Brown and Indigenous. The term was to promote empowering and self -determining language. It has been adopted in many parts of the world and in the US is often preferred over terms like people of colour.  By using "majority," the term attempts to counter the diminishing connotations of collective terms such as "ethnic minority", and is meant as an empowering reclaiming of this sentiment. Note, this is more common in discourses in the US than in the UK. This is best used when talking about ethnicities, not ancestries. '

alternatives:
  - 'While the term is used empower minoritised and excluded groups it will encompass a vast array of groups and cultures who identify differently. Be specific about which cultural group you are referring to. Instead, refer to "people historically or traditionally underserved". '
