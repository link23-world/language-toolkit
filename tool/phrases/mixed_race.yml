name: 'Mixed Race'
status: 'amber'
definition:
  "Mixed race is a societal term which refers to an individual of two or more racial backgrounds. The historical evolution behind this term typically assumes dual heritage from Black and White races, however, it could refer to any two or more backgrounds.Just like how race is assigned and ancestry is inferred, the concept of 'mixedness' is a social construct. These populations tend to have more blended genetic ancestry and more flexible social identities. When referring to mixes of ancestry, use 'admixed'."

  - 'Race'
  - 'Admixed'
why_we_care:
  'Individuals with recently mixed ancestry are different from admixed populations. An individual with Caribbean and white British parents are mixed race, while their Caribbean ancestry most likely is admixed.'
alternatives:
  - 'Mixed, when used in a societal context. Some people prefer the term Mixed as opposed to Mixed race when talking of racial profiles as they believe that other races are also born of mixtures.'
context:
  'In an everyday context mixed has become a common term in the UK, for instance, popularised by Natalie Morris and her book "Mixed/Other: Explorations of Multiraciality in Modern Britain."


  In a clinical context mixed race individuals rarely fall neatly into categories and therefore highlight the inconsistencies in the definitions of race and parameters that are used to classify populations.'
debate:
  'Mixed race individuals highlight that their racial identity can influence how health treatments are prescribed, depending on what singular race the clinician identifies them as. Mixed race individuals often prefer to self-assign their race and ethnicity.'
