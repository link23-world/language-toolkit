why_we_care:
  'Health disparities have a huge role to play in causes of a disease and are oftentimes hard to discern from variants when doing cross-root comparison. There is a history of tending to de-prioritise these in genomic analyses, but it is important to remember that the analyses carried out at Genomics England will be introduced back into a world where health disparities greatly affect outcomes.'
