why_we_care:
  'While it is difficult to identify and tackle systemic racism, genomic research practice should be aware of this to dismantle systematic approaches that may uphold unfair advantages to some people and disadvantages or mistreatment of others based on race.'
alternatives:
  - 'When describing the effects of inequalities on genomic outcomes it may be helpful to use evidence-based and specific descriptions like deprivation or other social determinants of health.'
context:
  'In an everyday context, systemic and systematic racism have been cited as causes of racial wealth gaps and disparities in health, education, employment and housing.


  In a clinical context, there is significant evidence that racial disparity can affect health outcomes. In health care both systemic and systematic racism have contributed to inequalities in treatment, experiences, and opportunities for development for the workforce.'
