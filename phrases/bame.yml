name: 'BAME'
status: red
definition:
  - 'BAME (or BME) is a collective term used to refer to individuals who are Black, Asian and from Minority Ethnic communities.'
related:
  - 'Underserved Communities'
  - 'Non-White'
  - 'Ethnic Minority and Minorities'
  - 'BIPOC'
why_we_care:
  'This umbrella term should be avoided at all cost as the surveys in the past have shown that people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic community would like to be addressed by their accurate ethnicity definitions.'
alternatives:
  - 'As much as possible provide an exhaustive list of specific ethnicities or if this is not practical (for example due to the length of the list), you might want to consider using collective terms that acknowledge these communitiesâ€™ positions of power (or lack thereof) in society such as "Underserved communities".'
context:
  ''
debate:
  'BAME is seen to emphasise certain ethnic minority groups (Asian and black) and exclude others (mixed, other and white ethnic minority groups). If used in scientific contexts, BAME can also mask differences between different ethnic groups and therefore create misleading interpretations of data. By implication, BAME is seen as a synonym of "Non-White". Of all the collective terms, BME/BAME is consistently seen as the least appropriate by individuals from those communities.'
