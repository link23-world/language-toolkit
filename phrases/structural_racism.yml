name: 'Structural Racism'
status: 'green'
definition:
  "Structural racism is an analytical framework that reveals how, on a political and institutional level, Black, Brown and other people who are not considered white, have generally had systematically biased, limited or no access to health care, housing, public transport, food, education, etc. compared to white counterparts. There is an acknowledgement that society as a whole tends to lean towards favouring one group of people. Often refers to political disadvantages that have existed silently e.g. lower socio-economic rates for Black and Pakistani groups or 'high rates of death from COVID amongst people of colour'."

why_we_care:
  'Structural racism determines whose genomes are collected, who does the research, who benefits from research, and to a large extent, impacts the research outcomes.'
alternatives:
  - 'Bias, while being specific about the bias.'
context:
  "In a political context structural racism is a framework for understanding racial oppression. Structural racism is historically rooted in colonialism and slavery and has long lasting impact on racialised people's mental, financial and physical wellbeing.


  In an everyday context structural racism is a way for individuals to understand how fundamental social structures impact their access to grocery shopping, green spaces, housing, education, etc."
debate:
  'Structural racism is present everywhere and everyone embodies structural racism or its impacts, whether intentionally or inadvertently. However, some people do not believe that they exhibit racism in their behavioural patterns and are resistant to analysing bias within their everyday life patterns.'
