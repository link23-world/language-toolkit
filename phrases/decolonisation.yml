name: 'Decolonisation'
status: 'amber'
definition:
  'Decolonisation is a process which refers to the historic and ongoing resistance to, and ultimate overcoming of, colonialism. Colonialism is the action or process of settling among and establishing control over the indigenous people of an area, and building structures which continue to oppress them. Decolonisation often includes giving land back to indigenous communities; centering the collective instead of the individual; and finding ways of redistributing resources in an equitable way. In the UK, many student movements have pushed towards decolonising the curriculum, for instance, instance, by insisting on teaching history that include the contributions of those who have been colonised and the injustices they have experienced.'

why_we_care:
  'In order to do meaningful work, we need to recognise the UK and much of Europe as the colonisers of countries most underserved in genomics. African, Asian and indigenous communities. Decolonisation in genomics includes the process of ensuring ethical data stewardship, building trust between genome participants and researchers, and building capacity in local areas is central to research practice. It is related to cultural competency and sensitivity. Decolonisation can also include reckoning with the past violence of medical research institutions that often exploited Black and indigenous bodies for experiments and extracting samples; as such recentering these populations as recipients of genomic research outcomes.

context:
  'In a political context decolonisation focuses on the redistribution of land, money and power to communities who have had these assets taken from them. The resources are used to build collective communities that are not structured around profit and exploitation.


  In a clinical context decolonisation means understanding that medical knowledge and research is founded on an extractive system with roots in colonialism and resisting this power structure. Decolonisation means to understand, for example, that dermatologists have primarily been trained to detect conditions on white skin, which can ultimately lead to people with darker skins having skin conditions that go undiagnosed or are diagnosed at late stages.'
debate:
  'Some people understand decolonisation as the period that follows independence from previous colonies. Decolonisation often has a much broader meaning, and requires an understanding of genomics and medicine as built on a violent history of exploitation and colonisation. It is not an event, but a long-term process.'
