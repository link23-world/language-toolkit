name: 'Predisposition'
status: 'amber'
definition:
  "This word describes the phenomenon whereby an organism already has a likelihood of
  experiencing a certain outcome. Factors contributing towards this outcome are usually considered to be 'innate'. Pre-disposition is often introduced as one piece of the puzzle, for example saying “Black and Brown people are more biologically pre-disposed to COVID”, but this takes away from the systemic and social, cultural and financial concepts at play which are also adding to the observation.


  Example of this word in context: Group X is predisposed to this disease."

debate:
  'It is important that the concept of predisposition should not take away from systemic inequalities and injustices that impact on healthcare. It is also important to note the weaponization of this concept in race science.'
