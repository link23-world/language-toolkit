## language-toolkit 0.1.3 (October 2022)

- Aman Ali
- Furaha Asani
- Sasha Henriques
- Salim, Hafsha and Summaiya from ****Smartlyte

**Learnings at this stage:**

- People with an academic background are more interested in who is a contributor to the work, patients, advisory groups and community spaces and more interested in the content
- More simple definitions are required, which later introduced a genomics context
- It is better to reference entry authors by referencing their external work rather than referencing each entry, so that there is a united voice

**Developments and changes**

- Introducing Key themes to categorise usage and a new view
- Removed dynamic term property as applies to all words
- Keep Versioning live and highlight main changes in the red introductory text
- Hide additional links so people get to the main content quicker
- Refine the need and key audience
- Introduce the infographic to the main page
- Added ‘innateness’ ‘pre-disposition’ and ‘poor response’ to words to be defined
- Started conversations in pulling in collaborators to the work in the long term, including moving to a blend of working with sciences and humanities
    - Working with EDI in future
    - how insights from this work can feed into others
- Adding a secion on why this is important, including “why dignity should be held” (see furaha’s notes)
- Adding a section on UK sepcific context as part of our values
- Tone of voice - make sure it avoids ‘policing’ so it is more approachable
- Referencing
    - Ed Hollox’s textbook for all his notes
    - Furaha’s podcast
- Move ‘poor’ to pending as we figure out the scope
- Work on highlighting the validity of people who know about genetics
- Make the initial definitions simpler and separate them from context
- check accessiblity guidelines, particularly for notion
- changed and embedded a new video with more appropriate subtitles
- Adding a to be defined banner under each of the entries
- removed all toggles - people were not finding the inforamtion this wat
- a ‘disclaimer under all words which are in pending section
- PDF printable version for people who want to review

## language-toolkit 0.1.2 (July 2022)

### **Product Testing round 1**

**Key external contributors included:**

- Mahantesh Biradar
- Ed Hollox
- Anna Need (internal)
- Amanda Picini (internal)
- Lyra Nightingale (internal)
- Dan Rhodes, Benvolent AI
- Sam Tallman (internal)
- Matteo Fumagalli, Clinician, QMUL

**Learnings at this stage:**

- The audience for the toolkit is very unclear, with each expert demographic believing that the toolkit is ‘not for people like them’
- The themes and use are unclear, particularly around when it is acceptable to use certain language
- Additional references is testing well
- The linear and continuous scrolling layout of notion makes it confusing to navigate reference information relating to methodology
- Population geneticists see clinicians on the periphery of their work but they are the main groups responsible for translating the population genetics work to patients, population members and the community.

**Key Developments/ Changes:**

- Expand on the infographics with comms team
- Added a Video to explain and introduce the key concepts
- Changed the emojis for the Amber column to be more formal
- Modified the language to be more formal for a genomics audience for all genomics realted terminology
- Changed the ‘context’ section to a simple ‘is this a genomics term’ toggle feature
- Additional of the terms “multiracial”
- Moving the terminology “WEIRD” to the amber category
- Adding additional terminology to split out Diverse Data as a programme and Diversity
- Expanding the thinking on the long-term change that the toolkit can bring, especially introductions to the toolkit to welcome week
- Thinking about Key themes to categorise useage

## language-toolkit 0.1.1 (May 2022)

At this point, we had a miro board which we migrated over to Notion to begin more in depth inputs. Over this stage, we split the work into ‘rounds’ making key changes after every 3-4 external expert interviews. The ordering of participants at this stage was purely based on availability but allowed us to better track progress.

**Research Methods at this stage:**

- Desk research on existing work done at GEL
- A literature review of papers
- 1-1 3-4 hour product testing interviews with a range of experts from different professions and backgrounds. These same professionals conducted an offline review.

**Preparation for the Toolkit for product testing:**

- Migrated from Miro to Notion and Made a live link
- Created drop-down menus for additional information, to make the introductory work more succinct

## language-toolkit 0.1.0 (March 2022)

At this stage, the project was very internal. The input was mainly focused on Genomics England colleagues in an attempt to understand how language was used across the company. Consultations with Alice Popejoy, Ewen Birney, and Semine Long-Callessen.

**Research Methods at this stage:**

- Desk research on existing work done at GEL
- A literature review of papers
- 1-1 interviews with 28 experts across GEL
- 3 focus groups and workshops with ELT, Cancer, Rare Disease and Newborns team
- GEL-wide survey on language around diversity.
- Initial discussions around monitoring and evaluation and how to track change and impact of the toolkit

**Learnings at this stage:**

- **Attitude insight:** People are uncomfortable talking about Race, Ethnicity and Ancestry, and this discomfort makes them create mental shortcuts to avoid discussing the nuance behind terminology
Example (quote from survey, anon) ”I use the term 'black' a lot but I have noticed that white people always start when I use it as if there is a better term to use. Consequently I (I am white) then feel nervous and have to psych myself up to say it the next time. I only get this reaction from white people though.”

- **Attitude Insight:** There is a strong correlation between **most comfortable** using terminology around Race, Ethnicity and Ancestry, and those **misusing terminology** in wrong and misleading contexts:
Example: A colleague on the DD team overhears a senior colleague with a bioinformatics background saying that “this is a Black genome”
- **Product Insight:** In order to gain the most uptake, especially with more senior stakeholders, we needed a system which feels intuitive
ELT member 01 - ”I just want a list of words I can and can’t use, and why”
ELT member 02 - “Is there a resource I can go to that just tells me what is acceptable?”
ELT member 03 - “Is it okay to say the work ‘mixed race’ nowadays?”
Programme Lead - “I it’
- We need to create a toolkit which straddles the balance between quick understandings of race, ethnicity and Ancestry and introductions to the complexity and nuance around these concepts

**Developments at this stage:**

- Survey 50 employees across GEL
- Drafted a concept on Miro ready for product testing
- Product testing with 10 internal colleagues across senior leadership, bioinformatics, comms team and design
- A set of values and a traffic light system
- A poster explaining the key concepts between race, ethnicity and ancestry
- Swapped all terminology related to GEL for Genomics England, so more relatable for a wide audience
